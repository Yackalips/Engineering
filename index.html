    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>This was the first week where we started basic engineering.
The first thing we did was 3d model a Rube Goldber machine on tinkercad. 
Another fun thing we did was 3d model a random object we owned.
I chose a Rubik's cube and I am happy with how it turned out</pre>

    <h3>Week 3</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>For week 3, we did the E project. We measured an E
and Gave it to someone else to cut out. We also started building the Rube
Goldberg Machine.</pre>


         <h3></h3>
         
    <p>
    <h3>Week 4</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>It has been four weeks now. This week we made paper boats
    and our goal was to hold as much wait as possible while still keeping 
    the boat floating. My boat did pretty decent; It stayed afloat for the 
    whole 5 minutes, but it didn't carry much weight. The solution to our 
    problem was to make it so as much surface area was touching the water
    as possible.</pre>    
    
    <h3>Week 5</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>For Week 5, we finally tested our rube Goldberg machine, and it
    worked. One thing we had to change was the supports. The original
    supports were not strong enough, so we made a bigger box. I will upload the 
    video later.</pre>    
    
    <h3>Week 6</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>It has now been 6 weeks and we are moving to electrical engineering.
    We disected an old laptop and it took a while. We had to unscrew a lot
    of things. We figured out what objects are like a fan, RAM, Proccessor, Graphics 
    card, Hard drive, etc. After putting the laptop back together, there were a few screws
    we missed.
    
    Picture coming soon :O</pre> 
    
    <h3>Week 7</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>For this week 7, we did 2 things. The first thing was design a prosthetic 
    limb for an animal. I made a dophin fin. For the second thing we did was make instructions
    on how to build a PB&J sandwhich. We had to be EXTREMLEY specific, otherwise
    it wouldn't look like a sandwhich.</pre>

    <p>
        
    <h3>Week 8</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>We are now getting into arospace engineering. It is basiclaly just rockets, airplanes,
    and anything that flies through air. On thursday, we made paper airplanes to see
    how close it could land next to the bucket. Mine landed pretty close.
    the plane itself was really good, it was just the way I threw it that didn't make
    it land in the bucket.</pre> 
    </p>

    <h3>Week 9</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>For week 9, we built bottle rockets. For our design, we used 3 fins made out of
    cardboard. for the top part, to reduce drag we made a paper cone. However, when we launched 
    our rocket, it didn't go as high as excpected. What we could have done better was mabe design our
    rocket to look more like an airplane.

     <h3>Week 10</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>
        This week we learned about environmental engineering. environmental engineering focuses on how
        you can remodel something so it pollutes the Earth as little as possible. One thing that we 
        built that was related to environmental engineering was water filters. First, the dirty water
        goes through big rocks to catch big materials. Then it goes through sand, and 
        finaly cotton. Our filter was the second most efficiant and filtered the water pretty well.

    </pre> 
    <h3>Week 11</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>
        This week was electrical engineering. We learned the difference between dc and ac circuits,
        how resistors work, and more. The first thing we did was build a parallel and series circuit
        in tinker cad.
        
        <img src= "circuit.png" ; width = 300px ; height = 200px > 
    </pre> 
    
        <h3>Week 12</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>
        We did more electrical engineering this week, but instead we built a real life model on a bread
        board. We built the ciruits and tested the voltages in different places.

    </pre> 
    
        <p>
    <h3>Week 13</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>This week we learned how to code our own lights with the arduinos code. 
    I made my circuit do really cool things, like gradually slowing down the 
    ticking speed, and adding a for loop to constantly change the variables. 
    Overall, We learned how to add the knowledge of code to electronic circuits.
</pre>    
    
        <p>
    <h3>Week 14</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>This week we learned about buisness engineering. This was fun because we got to come up with our own 
    inventions. My group was me, Brandon, Towa, and Greg. We designed the one and only "Foon"
    The foon is bassiclaly a much better spork, because instead of just being combined, the fork prongs come out
    of the spoon when the lever is pushed. We then pressented it to the class. unfortunatley, theo convinced the 
    class it was usless cause he had a spoon with a fork on the other side ._.</pre>

        <p>
    <h3>Week 15</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>We learned chemical engineering. We didn't do much this week, but we did make 
    ooblek (idk how to spell it). It was really fun to play with</pre>    
    
        </p>
    <img src= "Baldi.gif" ; width = 300px ; height = 200px > 
    <p>
        
    
        <p>
    <h3>Week 16</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>This week we are doing a big project. I partnered up with Greg to make an Arduino car. We found the best
    parts to use. For our parts we decided on the following: An Arduino UNO REV3 SMD, a 6-pack of mini-breadboards,
    an infrared controller with a receiver, a 9-volt battery, a jack connector for it, and this set: 4 wheels, 
    4 motors, 2 motor drives, and 40 of each type of wire - in-in, in-out, out-out. Hopefully it will work fine.
    Oh, and since I have a 3d printer, I can 3d print the shell for the car XD</pre>

        <p>
    <h3>Week 17??????</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>Does this week even exist????</pre>    
    
        <p>
    <h3>Week 18</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>We had a really cool challenge this week. We had to design something to carry a water balloon by using
    only sticks ad rubber bands. We then had to attatch it to a ruler and race. our design was called "The torch"
    At the beggining of the race, I kinda started a bit late, but I caught up. It was between me and two other people. 
    eventually I passed theo. I was about to get second place, but then I remembered that throwing it was allowed
    as long as it passed the line. So right as the other person was about to finish, I did my big brain strat and 
    threw the torch and ended up winning!
