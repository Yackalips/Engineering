    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>This was the first week where we started basic engineering.
The first thing we did was 3d model a Rube Goldber machine on tinkercad. 
Another fun thing we did was 3d model a random object we owned.
I chose a Rubik's cube and I am happy with how it turned out</pre>
