  <h3>Weekly Updates</h3>
  <h3>Week 1</h3>
  <p>
    We only went over on what the class was about and stuff.
  </p>
  <h3>Week 2</h3>
      <p>
        This was the first week where we started basic engineering. The first thing we did was 3D model a Rube Goldberg machine on Tinkercad. Another fun thing we did was 3D model a random object we owned. I chose a Rubik's Cube and I am happy with how it turned out.

      <h3>Week 3</h3>
      <p>
        For week 3, we did the E project. We measured an E and gave it to someone else to cut out. We also started building the Rube Goldberg Machine.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Week 4</h3>
      <p>
        It has been four weeks now. This week we made paper boats and our goal was to hold as much weight as possible while still keeping the boat floating. My boat did pretty decent; It stayed afloat for the whole 5 minutes, but it didn't carry much weight. The solution to our problem was to make it so as much surface area was touching the water as possible.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Week 5</h3>
      <p>
        For Week 5, we finally tested our Rube Goldberg machine, and it worked. One thing we had to change was the supports. The original supports were not strong enough, so we made a bigger box. I will upload the video later.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Week 6</h3>
      <p>
       

     <h3>Week 7</h3>
      </p>
      <pre>For this week 7, we did 2 things. The first thing was design a prosthetic 
      limb for an animal. I made a dophin fin. For the second thing we did was 
      make instructions on how to build a PB&J sandwhich. We had to be EXTREMLEY specific, otherwise
      it wouldn't look like a sandwhich.</pre>

      <p>
          
      <h3>Week 8</h3>
      </p>
      <pre>We are now getting into arospace engineering. It is basiclaly just rockets, airplanes,
      and anything that flies through air. On thursday, we made paper airplanes to see
      how close it could land next to the bucket. Mine landed pretty close.
      the plane itself was really good, it was just the way I threw it that didn't make
      it land in the bucket.</pre> 
      </p>

      <h3>Week 9</h3>
      </p>
      <pre>For week 9, we built bottle rockets. For our design, we used 3 fins made out of
    cardboard. for the top part, to reduce drag we made a paper cone. However, when we launched 
    our rocket, it didn't go as high as excpected. What we could have done better was mabe design our
    rocket to look more like an airplane.

     <h3>Week 10</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>
        This week we learned about environmental engineering. environmental engineering focuses on how
        you can remodel something so it pollutes the Earth as little as possible. One thing that we 
        built that was related to environmental engineering was water filters. First, the dirty water
        goes through big rocks to catch big materials. Then it goes through sand, and 
        finaly cotton. Our filter was the second most efficiant and filtered the water pretty well.

    </pre> 
    <h3>Week 11</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>
        This week was electrical engineering. We learned the difference between dc and ac circuits,
        how resistors work, and more. The first thing we did was build a parallel and series circuit
        in tinker cad.
        
        <img src= "circuit.png" ; width = 300px ; height = 200px > 
    </pre> 
    
        <h3>Week 12</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>
        We did more electrical engineering this week, but instead we built a real life model on a bread
        board. We built the ciruits and tested the voltages in different places.

    </pre> 
    
        <p>
    <h3>Week 13</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>This week we learned how to code our own lights with the arduinos code. 
    I made my circuit do really cool things, like gradually slowing down the 
    ticking speed, and adding a for loop to constantly change the variables. 
    Overall, We learned how to add the knowledge of code to electronic circuits.
</pre>

        <p>
    <h3>Week 1</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>This week we learned about buisness engineering. This was fun because we got to come up with our own 
    inventions. My group was me, Brandon, Towa, and Greg. We designed the one and only "Foon"
    The foon is bassiclaly a much better spork, because instead of just being combined, the fork prongs come out
    of the spoon when the lever is pushed. We then pressented it to the class. unfortunatley, theo convinced the 
    class it was usless cause he had a spoon with a fork on the other side ._.</pre>

        <p>
    <h3>Week 2</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>We learned chemical engineering. We didn't do much this week, but we did make 
    ooblek (idk how to spell it). It was really fun to play with</pre>    
    
        </p>

        <p>
    <h3>Week 3</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>This week we are doing a big project. I partnered up with Greg to make an Arduino car. We found the best
    parts to use. For our parts we decided on the following: An Arduino UNO REV3 SMD, a 6-pack of mini-breadboards,
    an infrared controller with a receiver, a 9-volt battery, a jack connector for it, and this set: 4 wheels, 
    4 motors, 2 motor drives, and 40 of each type of wire - in-in, in-out, out-out. Hopefully it will work fine.
    Oh, and since I have a 3d printer, I can 3d print the shell for the car XD</pre>

        <p>
    <h3>Week 5</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>We had a really cool challenge this week. We had to design something to carry a water balloon by using
    only sticks ad rubber bands. We then had to attatch it to a ruler and race. our design was called "The torch"
    At the beggining of the race, I kinda started a bit late, but I caught up. It was between me and two other people. 
    eventually I passed theo. I was about to get second place, but then I remembered that throwing it was allowed
    as long as it passed the line. So right as the other person was about to finish, I did my big brain strat and 
    threw the torch and ended up winning!
    
    [picture coming soon]</pre> 
    
        <h3>Week 9</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>
    I was absent that week ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
    </pre> 
    
            <p>
    <h3>Week 10</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>This week we were doing an egg drop. We had to measure everything completley accurate and to scale. Our design 
    was based around an egg surrounded by cotton balls and sticks for support. For a soft landing, we put staws at the bottom.
    to make it fall slowly, we added a parachute (which ended up working really well), and a balloon on top to keep it upright.
    The egg we were givin had already started with a slight crack in it. When we first launched it, the wind blew the egg into a
    support beam so we had to start again. The second time, the egg flew down slowly and survived (minus the crack that kinda 
    got bigger)
    
    <img src= "egg_cad.png" ; width = 300px ; height = 400px ></pre> 
    
        <h3>Week 11</h3>
    </p>
    <pre>We dropped the egg. It went alright. If the egg didn't have a crack in it before it definatley would have survived better.
    I think our parachute however worked pretty well and worked as intented. It created anough dragon to cause the egg to slow down 
    landing softly. If we did not have a parachute attatched, the egg would have definatley exploaded.

        <h3>Week 12</h3>
     We are doing a new project this week, which is card board boat racing. We had to make an exact model of what it will look like.
     I think that it will work pretty well. We went with a triangle design in front and rectangle in the middle. The two people that 
     are going to ride the boat will be me and Towa. I just hope it doesn't sink.
    </pre> 
    <img src= "box.png" ; width = 300px ; height = 300px ></pre> 
    
            <h3>Week 13</h3>
     This week we actually started to cut the cardboard peices. It was not too hard, but there
     were a few changes we had to make. One of the changes was making the boat a bit smaller since before
     it was way too big. Another change we made was adding multople layers. This is so the boat has a less
     chance of sinking. Our goal is to not make it sink.
    </pre> 
    <img src= "angle.jpeg" ; width = 300px ; height = 300px ></pre> 
    
            <h3>Week 14</h3>
     This week we made our prototype, but havn't actually tested it yet. The prototype is 4 times smaller
     than the actuall boat, so it should hold 1/4th our weight. Towa and I are going to be the ones that ride in
     the actual boat itself. We also cut out triangles and tapped a few things together.
    </pre> 
    <img src= "angle.jpeg" ; width = 300px ; height = 300px ></pre> 
    
    <h3>Week 15</h3>
     This week we made a prototype of the boat. The prototype was exactly in proportion, except it was 1/4 the size of the original boat. Surprisingly, it held all 5 bricks, but there was a smalle leak in one of the corners. So as long as we tape the actual boat well enough, we should be fine.
    </pre> 
    <img src= "protoboat_water.png" ; width = 300px ; height = 300px ></pre> 
    
    <h3>Week 16</h3>
     This week we finished building most of the boat. We did not use that much tape at all and still have a
     lot left to use. We added a second layer on the bottom of the boat and also plan to add another layer to 
     the sides. One thing we used for support was the segregator which also doubles as a table. It is a peice
     of cardboard which goes across the whole boat along with another peice under for support. We named it 
     the segregator because it segregates both the people in the boat.
    </pre> 
    <img src= "boat_one_layer.png" ; width = 300px ; height = 300px ></pre> 
    <h3>Week 17</h3>
     <p>For this week, we started to decorate the boat. Our boats name is the Burger King Shark, since brandons initials are BK, and Towa though the boat kind of looked like a shark. But this week we started to decorate it and make it look like a shark. We also added the burger king song lyrics to the boat.</p>
     
    <img src= "shark_face.png" ; width = 300px ; height = 300px ></pre> 
    <img src= "song.png" ; width = 300px ; height = 300px ></pre> 
    <h3>Week 18</h3>
     
    <p>We finally finished building the boat! I would say it looks pretty good. There are still a few touch ups we need to make thought but I think it will work out good. We also made paper roller coasters this week. The goal was to make a roller coaster out of only paper and tape, and 2 loops. Only one of out loops worked, but the roller coaster still worked out pretty well.</p>
    <img src= "coaster_done.png" ; width = 300px ; height = 300px ></pre> 
    <h3>Week 19</h3>
     
    <p>This is the second to last week of school! For our last challenge, we made a book holder. Our goal was to make a book holder out of only paper and tape, and make it so it doesn't tip over when punched. Our design was simpe. We made two triangles on the side, and the width being longer than the books hight preventing it from falling. To make the paper strong, I figured out how to make DIY cardboard by zig zagging paper and then surrounding it by more paper. Surprisingly it worked great and did not tip over.</p>
